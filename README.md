This project is designed for the user to manage the different Dungeons & Dragons characters that they have created and which teams they are a part of. Knowing these details will help manage and organize which characters they need at a given time, such as, when they are prepping for game day. It is very easy to lose track of your characters if you are involved in multiple campaigns or if you happen to play infrequently.
